# DSA-Project-Femi-Abugo
DSA Data Analysis Project of Two Case Studies. I present here Case Study 1 on Amazon Product Review Analysis. As a Junior Data Analyst engaged by the company, the task is about analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

A company description was provided with data sets comprising  
*        Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 
•       Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 
•       Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values 
Total Records: 1,465 with TotalFields: 16 columns

The steps taken include cleaning the data, building pivot tables to provide answere to 14 analytical questins, and developing a dash board from which the management can make descions about products, markets and customers.
